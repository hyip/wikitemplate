<h1>wiki.template</h1>

<p>
  This is a wiki template. The main point of this is to integrate the foundation
  css framework with nanoc and preparing everything to be wiki-ish, so one can
  use this as a start for creating a wiki without having to deal with
  stylesheets and everything.
</p>

<p>
  After the main things are done (the layout), integration for code listings and
  latex-like formula integration will be included, but for the first step the
  goal is to serve a starting point for creating a wiki with Markdown.
</p>

<p>
  Maybe other markup languages will be included later on.
